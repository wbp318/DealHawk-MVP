# DealHawk Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 17, 2026*

DealHawk is a Chrome extension that scores vehicle deals, calculates true dealer cost, and generates negotiation targets. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## Data Collected

**Without an account (free tier):**
- Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) from dealer listing pages
- Listing prices, MSRP, and vehicle specifications (year, make, model, trim)
- Days on lot and dealer information visible on listing pages
- Deal scores and negotiation targets generated by our scoring engine

**With an account:**
- Email address (for login only)
- Hashed password (bcrypt — we never store plaintext passwords)
- Saved vehicle data and deal alert preferences

## How We Use Your Data

- Scoring vehicle deals and generating negotiation targets
- Decoding VINs to retrieve vehicle specifications
- Tracking saved vehicles and evaluating deal alert criteria (authenticated users)
- No data is used for advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than the features described above

## Payments

DealHawk Pro subscriptions are processed by **Stripe**, a PCI-compliant payment processor.

- Your **email address** is shared with Stripe to create a billing customer record
- **Card details** are entered on Stripe's hosted checkout page — DealHawk never sees, stores, or processes your card number
- A **Stripe customer ID** is stored in our database to link your DealHawk account to your Stripe billing record
- Subscription status (active, canceled, etc.) is synced via Stripe webhooks
- You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through the Stripe billing portal, accessible from the extension popup

For Stripe's privacy practices, see [Stripe's Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

## Third-Party Services

DealHawk connects to the following external services:

- **NHTSA vPIC API** (U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) — a free government API used to decode VINs into vehicle specifications. Only VINs are sent; no personally identifiable information is transmitted.
- **Stripe** — payment processing for Pro subscriptions. See the Payments section above.

We do not use analytics services, ad networks, or any other third-party tracking.

## Data Storage

- **Development:** SQLite local database
- **Production:** PostgreSQL with encrypted connections
- Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes and are never logged or exposed
- Auth tokens (JWT) are stored in the extension's local storage and expire after 30 minutes (access) or 7 days (refresh)

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties. Period.

## Your Rights

- **Delete your account** at any time — this removes your email, saved vehicles, and deal alerts
- **Delete individual saved vehicles** from the Saved tab
- **Delete deal alerts** from the Alerts tab
- **Log out** to clear stored auth tokens from the extension

## Extension Permissions

DealHawk requests only the minimum permissions needed:

| Permission | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `storage` | Caching API responses and auth tokens locally |
| `sidePanel` | Displaying the deal analysis UI |
| `activeTab` | Reading the current dealer listing page to extract vehicle data |

We do **not** request `tabs`, `history`, `bookmarks`, or any other broad permissions.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy, the new version will be posted at the same URL and the "Last updated" date will change. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance.
