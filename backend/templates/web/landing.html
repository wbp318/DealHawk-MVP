        <h2>How DealHawk Scores Deals</h2>
        <p>Every deal gets a weighted score based on five factors: price vs. true dealer cost (35%), days on lot (25%), available incentives (20%), market supply (12%), and timing (8%). Higher scores mean more savings for you.</p>
        <p>True dealer cost goes beyond invoice price. We subtract holdback (the hidden rebate dealers get from manufacturers) and add any dealer cash incentives to calculate what the dealer actually paid. That's your starting point for negotiation.</p>
