Copyright (c) 2026 William Brooks Parker. All rights reserved.

DealHawk is the exclusive proprietary property of William Brooks Parker,
domiciled in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana (hereinafter "Owner"). This
license governs all use of the DealHawk software, including but not limited

================================================================================
SECTION 1 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
================================================================================

This Software is protected under the following federal and state laws:

  (a) FEDERAL COPYRIGHT — 17 U.S.C. §§ 101-1332 (Copyright Act of 1976, as
      amended). The Software constitutes an original work of authorship fixed
      in a tangible medium of expression. The Owner holds exclusive rights
      under 17 U.S.C. § 106, including the rights to reproduce, prepare
      derivative works, distribute copies, and display the work publicly.

  (b) DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT — 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (DMCA). Any
      circumvention of technological measures that effectively control access
      to the Software, including but not limited to bypassing authentication
      mechanisms, API rate limits, or license verification, is a federal
      offense subject to civil liability under 17 U.S.C. § 1203 (actual
      damages or statutory damages of $200 to $25,000 per violation) and
      criminal penalties under 17 U.S.C. § 1204 (fines up to $500,000 and
      imprisonment up to 5 years for first offense).

  (c) COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT — 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (CFAA). Unauthorized
      access to, or exceeding authorized access to, the Software's backend
      systems, APIs, or databases constitutes a federal offense. Violators
      are subject to civil liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g) and criminal
      penalties including fines and imprisonment up to 10 years.

  (d) ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE ACT — 18 U.S.C. §§ 1831-1839. The Software's
      scoring algorithms, pricing models, negotiation logic, and dealer cost
      calculations constitute trade secrets. Misappropriation, theft, or
      unauthorized disclosure of these trade secrets is a federal crime
      punishable by fines up to $5,000,000 and imprisonment up to 10 years
      (18 U.S.C. § 1832).

  (e) DEFEND TRADE SECRETS ACT — 18 U.S.C. § 1836 (DTSA, 2016). The Owner
      may bring a civil action in federal court for trade secret
      misappropriation and seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages,
      exemplary damages up to 2x actual damages for willful and malicious
      misappropriation, and reasonable attorney's fees.

  (f) LOUISIANA TRADE SECRETS ACT — La. R.S. 51:1431-1439. The Software's
      algorithms, business logic, and proprietary data derive independent
      economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable,
      and the Owner has taken reasonable efforts to maintain their secrecy
      (La. R.S. 51:1431(4)). Misappropriation entitles the Owner to
      injunctive relief (La. R.S. 51:1433), damages including unjust
      enrichment (La. R.S. 51:1434), and attorney's fees for willful and
      malicious misappropriation (La. R.S. 51:1435).

  (g) LOUISIANA DATABASE PROTECTION — La. R.S. 51:1961-1966. The compiled
      invoice pricing data, incentive program records, holdback rates, and
      market supply data contained in the Software's database are protected
      as a substantial investment of the Owner. Unauthorized extraction or
      reutilization of a substantial part of the database contents is
      prohibited.

  (h) WIRE FRAUD — 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Use of interstate wire communications
      to obtain the Software or its trade secrets by means of fraud, false
      pretenses, or deception constitutes wire fraud, punishable by fines and
      imprisonment up to 20 years.

================================================================================
