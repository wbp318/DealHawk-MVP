## Market Overview

February 2026 is a **strong buyer's market** for full-size trucks. Key data points:

- **~700,000 leftover 2025 models** sitting on lots nationwide
- **~85,000 unsold 2024 models** still on lots (some 12-18 months old)
- **Industry average days supply:** 76 days (near the historical ~75-day target)
- **Total U.S. new vehicle inventory:** ~2.8 million units (down 4.8% YoY)
- Stellantis (Ram/Dodge/Jeep) brands sit **well above 4 months (120+ days)** of supply
- **25% tariffs** on imports from Canada/Mexico (effective Nov 1, 2025) mean pre-tariff inventory on lots may be a better value than newly ordered trucks

### Days Supply by Brand (February 2026)

| Brand/Model | Days Supply | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Ram 3500 | **342 days** | Extreme oversupply |
| Ram 2500 | **318 days** | Slowest-selling vehicle in America |
| Ram 1500 | **120+ days** | Heavy oversupply |
| Ford F-Series | **100+ days** | Above average |
| Ford F-150 (peak) | 141 days | Peaked Jan 2025 |
| GMC/Chevy trucks | Above average | Elevated but improving |
| **Industry Average** | **76 days** | -- |
| Toyota (comparison) | 33 days | Tight supply, no deals |

**Bottom line:** Ram trucks have the most leverage for buyers. Ford is second. GMC/Chevy are competitive with strong rebates.

## Inventory by Brand

### Ram / Stellantis - Maximum Buyer Leverage

Stellantis misjudged post-pandemic pricing and produced far more than the market absorbed. Ram HD trucks (2500/3500) occupy **four of the bottom 10 spots** in the slowest-selling vehicle rankings. Some take **6+ months to sell on average**.

- **Ram 2500:** 6,311 unsold 2024 units as of late 2025
- **Ram 3500:** 3,897 unsold 2024 units as of late 2025
- **Average rebate across all Ram models:** $8,900
- Stellantis stock dropped 10% on concerns over "bloated" inventory

### Ford - Improved but Still Elevated

Ford has had a persistent oversupply of F-150s, though it's improving:

- **37,184 leftover 2023-2024 F-Series trucks** combined (as of late 2025)
- Nearly **3,000 unsold 2024 F-150s** still sat on lots in late 2025
- Ford launched a specific **"90+ Day Aged Inventory Dealer Cash"** program
- Exception: **Ford F-450 Super Duty** is the fastest-selling pickup (~60 days)

### GMC / Chevrolet - Middle of the Pack

- Moving but not quickly; "far behind" Toyota in selling speed
- GMC offering up to **$9,350 in cash rebates** on 2025 Sierra 1500
- Chevy Silverado 1500 getting **1.9% APR for 36 months**

## Fleet & Farm Discount Programs

### Fleet Qualification (Count Your Farm Equipment!)

| Program | Requirement | What Counts |
|---|---|---|
| **Ford FIN** (Fleet ID Number) | 5 new vehicles in past year OR 15 total owned | Tractors, combines, UTVs, backhoes, self-propelled equipment |

| **Ram BusinessLink** | 15+ vehicles OR intent to buy 5+ | Similar to above |

> **Key:** Ford explicitly counts self-propelled farm equipment (tractors, backhoes, etc.) toward the 5-vehicle minimum. If your farming operation has tractors + UTVs + combines + existing trucks, you likely already qualify.

### Ford Plan Pricing

| Plan | Who Qualifies | Approximate Discount |
|---|---|---|
| **A-Plan** | Ford employees & immediate family | 8-10% below MSRP |
| **Z-Plan** | Ford retirees | Same as A-Plan |
| **X-Plan** | Partners, suppliers, Farm Bureau | 3-5% below MSRP |
| **D-Plan** | Dealer employees | A-Plan + $100 |

**X-Plan formula:** Invoice - 0.4% + $275 program fee. Doc fee capped at $150. Up to 2 PINs per year.

### AgPack Program (Major Farm Savings)

## How to Find Aged Inventory Online

### Primary Tools

#### 1. CarGurus (cargurus.com) - Best for Days on Lot
- Shows **"Days at this dealer"** and **"Days on CarGurus"** on each listing
- Displays **price history** with every price drop tracked over time
- Sort by **"Best Deal First"** to find underpriced trucks
- Deal ratings: Great Deal > Good Deal > Fair Deal > High Price > Overpriced
- **Pro tip:** If "3 days at dealer" but "180 days on CarGurus" = truck shuffled between dealers (hard to sell)

#### 2. AutoTempest (autotempest.com) - Widest Net
- Meta-search across Cars.com, TrueCar, eBay Motors, Carvana, AutoTrader, CarGurus, Facebook Marketplace, and Craigslist simultaneously
- Best for casting the widest possible search across all platforms

#### 3. CarEdge (caredge.com) - Market Intelligence
- Shows **Market Day Supply (MDS)** by model
- Monthly fastest/slowest selling vehicle reports
- Days on market for individual listings
- Free and paid tiers

#### 4. Cars.com - Deal Badges
- ML-powered deal ratings: **Great Deal, Good Deal, Fair Price, Well-Equipped**
- Considers regional supply/demand in analysis
- Filter by deal rating to show only Great/Good deals

#### 5. OEM Inventory Search
- **Ford:** [ford.com/inventory/f150](https://www.ford.com/inventory/f150)
- **Ram:** [ramtrucks.com](https://www.ramtrucks.com)
- **GMC:** [gmc.com](https://www.gmc.com)
- Search for 2024-2025 models still in stock = definitionally aged

#### 6. VIN Verification Tools

1. Start at **CarEdge** to identify which models have highest Market Day Supply
2. Search **AutoTempest** with 500-mile radius from central MS to cover all target states
3. Filter for **2024 and 2025 model years** specifically
4. On **CarGurus**, click into each listing to check days at dealer (target 90+ days)
5. On **Cars.com**, filter for **"Great Deal"** badges
6. Cross-reference VINs across platforms to verify true age
7. Check build dates via VIN decoder or door jamb sticker
8. Look up current incentives on **Edmunds** and **KBB** (enter your zip for regional offers)

## Negotiation Playbook

### Why Dealers Are Desperate to Sell Aged Inventory

**Floor Plan Financing:** Dealers don't own their inventory outright. They borrow through floor plan lines of credit and pay **$250-$400/month in interest** per truck ($7.90/day average in Q1 2025).

**Curtailment Penalties:** After 90-120 days, lenders require **5-20% of the loan principal** to be paid down. On a $55,000 invoice truck, that's **$5,500+ out of pocket** just to keep it on the lot.

**A truck sitting 180+ days has cost the dealer $3,000-$6,000+ in carrying costs. At 300+ days, they are deeply underwater.**

### Price Targets by Age

| Days on Lot | Starting Offer | Target Settlement | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30-60 days | 8-12% below MSRP | 5-10% below | Normal negotiation range |
| 90+ days | 15-18% below MSRP | 10-15% below | Curtailment kicks in. Ford offers hidden $1,500-$2,000 dealer cash |
| 180+ days | 20-25% below MSRP | 15-20% below | Serious carrying costs. Dealer likely losing money |
| 300+ days | 25-30% below MSRP | 20-25% below | Hemorrhaging money. Documented at 20-25% off |

### Best Timing

| When | Why |
|---|---|
| **Last 3-5 days of any month** | Monthly quotas for salespeople and dealership |
| **Last week of March, June, Sept, Dec** | Quarterly manufacturer bonuses |
| **Late December** | Year-end + quarter-end + month-end = maximum pressure |
| **Holiday weekends** | Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Black Friday = promo incentives |

### Tactics

1. **Get pre-approved** through a credit union before visiting any dealer
2. **Get 3-5 written email quotes** from internet sales departments across your target states
3. **Contact internet sales managers** (not floor salespeople) - they work on volume
4. Present the lowest quote to your preferred dealer: *"I have a written offer from [dealer] for $X. Can you beat it?"*
5. **Ask specifically:** *"What is the maximum incentive stack available on this specific VIN?"*
6. **Visit in the last 3 days of the month** and say: *"I am ready to sign today if we can agree on a number."*
7. **Walking away** is your most powerful tool:
   - Set your max price before walking in. Do not deviate
   - When they counter above your max: *"I appreciate your time, but that doesn't work. Here's my card - if anything changes, call me."*
   - Actually leave. ~50% of the time they call back within 24-72 hours
   - Follow up in a week if they don't call: *"Is that truck still there? My offer still stands."*

### What NOT to Accept

- Dealer "documentation fees" above $200 (negotiate or walk)
- Mandatory dealer add-ons (nitrogen tires, paint protection, VIN etching)
- "Market adjustment" markups - the market does NOT support markups on any of these trucks right now
- Financing pressure if you have better terms from your credit union

---

## Two-Truck Buying Leverage

Buying two trucks at once gives you legitimate additional leverage:

- Two sales help the salesperson hit **personal bonus thresholds** faster
- Two sales help the dealership hit **manufacturer volume tier bonuses** (these can be worth tens of thousands to the dealer)
- Documented savings of **$2,500-$5,000 collectively** on dual purchases
- Best at month-end/quarter-end when they may need exactly 2 more units

### How to Execute

1. Contact the **internet sales manager** directly (not a floor salesperson)
2. Say: *"I'm looking to purchase two trucks. I'd like to work with one salesperson and negotiate them together. What can you offer on these two specific vehicles?"*
3. Time this for the **last 3 days of a quarter** (March 31, June 30, Sept 30, Dec 31)
4. If the dealership won't give you a deal, contact their competitors: *"[Other dealer] couldn't make the numbers work on two trucks. Can you?"*

## Aged Inventory Inspection Checklist

A "new" truck sitting 6-12+ months can develop real problems. Inspect for:

- [ ] **Tires** - Check for flat spots (vibration at highway speed) and sidewall dry rot/cracking. Check DOT date codes. Demand new tires or $800-$1,200 off if degraded
- [ ] **Battery** - Request voltage/load test results. If jump-started on the lot, likely degraded. Demand a new battery
- [ ] **Fuel** - Gas degrades after ~6 months. Request fuel drain and refill if sitting 6+ months
- [ ] **Rubber seals** - Check all door seals, window seals, under-hood hoses for cracking from UV
- [ ] **Wiper blades** - Likely degraded from sun exposure. Cheap fix but indicator of lot exposure
- [ ] **Rodent damage** - Inspect under hood for droppings, nests, chewed wires (soy-based insulation attracts rodents). Check cabin air filter area and engine air filter box. Wiring harness damage = $1,000-$5,000+ repair
- [ ] **Paint/exterior** - Check for sun damage, lot damage (door dings, cart scratches), bird droppings/sap etched into clear coat, hail damage
- [ ] **Brake rotors** - Surface rust is normal, but deep pitting from months of sitting may require replacement
- [ ] **In-service date** - Some manufacturers start the warranty clock when the dealer receives the truck, NOT when you buy it. If 10 months of warranty is already gone, negotiate warranty extension or additional discount

### Demand Before Signing

- [ ] Fresh oil change (oil breaks down from condensation even without driving)
- [ ] New battery or documented load test
- [ ] New wiper blades
- [ ] Tire inspection with documented tread depth and DOT date codes
- [ ] Brake rotor inspection
- [ ] Full under-hood inspection for rodent damage
- [ ] Fresh fuel or fuel system cleaning (if 6+ months old)
- [ ] Fresh Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) - not one done months ago
- [ ] Warranty start-date reset or free extended warranty
- [ ] Test drive of at least 20 minutes at highway speed

## Section 179 Tax Deduction

For a farming operation, trucks over 6,000 lbs GVWR qualify for **full first-year Section 179 expensing**:

| Detail | 2026 |
|---|---|
| **Section 179 limit** | $2.56 million |
| **Bonus depreciation** | 100% (restored for property acquired after Jan 19, 2025) |
| **Heavy SUV cap** | $32,000 (but pickup trucks with 6+ ft beds are NOT subject to this cap) |
| **Business use requirement** | Must be used >50% for business |

**Qualifying trucks (all over 6,000 lbs GVWR):**
- All F-250, F-350, F-450 Super Duty
- All Ram 2500, 3500
- All Silverado/Sierra 2500HD, 3500HD

## Dealer Cost Breakdown

Understanding what the dealer actually paid helps you negotiate:

### The Math

```
Example: $65,000 MSRP truck

MSRP:                         $65,000
Invoice Price:                $59,800  (~8% below MSRP)
Minus Holdback (3% of MSRP): -$1,950  (refunded to dealer quarterly)
Minus Dealer Cash:            -$2,000  (manufacturer-to-dealer incentives, varies)
                              --------
True Dealer Cost:             ~$55,850
```

> When a dealer says "I'm losing money at that price," they're almost always calculating from invoice, not from true cost after holdback and hidden incentives. A deal at invoice price still earns the dealer $2,000-$4,000+ in hidden margin.
